1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
Ans)
To tackle the challenge, I would parse the input CSV file, identify the cells with formulas and evaluate them, and then output the result to a new CSV file. To evaluate the formulas, I would use a library or write custom code that can handle simple arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction.

2. What type of errors you would you check for?
Ans)
While evaluating the formulas, I would check for the following types of errors:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Syntax errors: Ensure that the formula has the correct syntax, for example, the correct number of operators and operands.

2.Division by zero: Avoid dividing by zero, which would result in an error.

3.Circular references: Ensure that the formula does not contain circular references, which would cause the evaluation to run indefinitely.

4.Reference errors: Check if the cells referenced in the formula exist and if they contain valid values.

5.Type mismatches: Ensure that the operands in the formula are of the correct type, for example, that they are numbers and not text.

3. How might a user break your code?
Ans)
A user could break the code by inputting a CSV file that does not adhere to the expected format, for example, using an invalid character as a separator, or by including formulas that have invalid syntax, circular references, or non-existent cell references.
